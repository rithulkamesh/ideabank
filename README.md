# Idea Bank

A Simple Idea bank written with Rust

To Install, simply clone the repo and run `cargo install --path .` to get a path linked binary. Or you can build and put it in your custom path folder.

Run `ideabank help` for more help on the tool

**Please note:** Windows users have to tweak some settings to get the editor working, but Unix users who have vim installed should have no problems
